{% block content %} Stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) is a disease that emerged off the coast of Miami, Florida, in 2014. Since its discovery, it has spread throughout Florida's Coral Reefs and into the Caribbean. Given the magnitude of this disease on coral reef populations, and its geographic range there have been several studies attempting to identify the causative agent(s) of SCTLD. The cause of SCTLD is unknown, but bacteria are predicted to play a role in disease progression. 

Since the microbiome may be important in understanding SCTLD, several 16S rRNA studies have been conducted to try to understand how bacteria contribute to SCTLD. As 16S rRNA data is continuously emerging the goal of this tool is to allow users to integrate their SCTLD 16S rRNA data with an SCTLD 16S meta-analysis.
